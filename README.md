# AQCalibrationFramework
A calibration framework that allows automatically calibration electrochemical air quality sensors. The models are generated in 2 ways: using csv data as input, reading directly from a postgreSQL database instance generated with the provided script.

The framework allow users that have electrochemical sensors and legal station or laboratory measurements as reference data generating a calibration model for each sensor, and finally to apply it in oreder to obtain pollutants concentration. 

The framework is based on a data structure that can be generated in the PostgreSQL DBMS executing the attached script. This data strucutre must be populated with sensors data and target measurements of pollutants concentration and takes trace of all the changes in the status of the sensors. The data collected in 'calibration' status are associated directly with the legal station data and the model is generated automatically given the calibration interval of time to consider. This data structure also allows associating the calibrated measurements with the description and parameters of the algorithm used to generate them. In this way, the results of different approaches are easy to compare. Moreover, when the model is applied the table sensor_calibrated_observation is directly populated with the predicted values.
In order to set up the connecting with the database the file trafair_DB_config should be modified inserting in 'trafair_db_getConnection' the right password and database name.
Alternatively, the framework can be used with 'csv' files but this is suggested only for teasting purpose since the user must take trace of all the changes in the sensor status, associate correctly the measurements of the sensors with the target measurements and compare the results of different approaches can be more difficult.

There are several actions that can be performed:
- trainAndSaveDillToFile: this action performs the training of the given model on the given period of time and create a dill file that is saved locally.
- trainToDB: this action performs the training of the given model on the given period of time and create a dill file saved locally and generate the instace of the new                model in the postgreSQL database.
- trainAndSaveDillToFileFromInfo: this action is created for the regeneration of an old dill. It uses a info file containing the information of the dill to generate a                                     new dill. It can be used also to avoid the insertion of the parameters that will be specified in the info file. The data to train the                                   model should be saved in a csv file and are not obtained directly querying the database. The generated dill is saved locally.
- getInfoFromDillFile: this function allows obtaining the info file from the dill. It is used to regenerate an old dill before applying trainAndSaveDillToFileFromInfo.
- applyCalibrationSensorPollutantDillDf: this action allows applying a dill to test data int eh given itnerval saved in the database, generating a csv file with the                                              pollutant concentration for the given sensor. It is useful for testing the dills but it does not write the calibrated values in                                          the dataframe.
- applyDillsToSensor: this action is the right way to apply the calirbation and save the calibrated values for all the pollutants in a unique row in the dataframe. Once                        all the models have been generated for a sensor a new row should be inserted in the sensor_calirbation table of the database with a reference to                        the models you are willing to use. Then the id of this row (id_calirbation) will be specified and all the calirbated observations with the                              pollutants concentration will refer to this specific calibration.

Examples of shell scripts that combine these functionalities are available in the ShellScripts folder in thsi repository.
